A paradigm shift of ever-increasing automation is pushing for the development of smart Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) appli-
cations to achieve efficiencies in urban environments. However, their implementation has proved challenging due to several risks
associated with dense living areas, including (i) a lack of precision and reliability, (ii) privacy concerns, and (iii) short battery
life. Classic methods of GPS/GNSS and vision-based navigation both present major shortcomings to address these issues, which
highlights the need to develop a novel framework in support of smart UAV systems for cities. This article presents an innovative
hardware platform featuring a scalable and efficient UAV charging solution based on battery-swapping, combined with a high-
accuracy positioning hotspot system, relying exclusively on data fusion of UWB and IMU. To achieve this, a versatile landing
platform is built, with a previously unseen suboptimal UWB constellation of 50x50cm, which is iteratively improved through mod-
elling and layout optimisation. The system is integrated with a small quadcopter and an improved G-M estimation robust Extended
Kalman Filter. The proposed approach is validated through comprehensive testing of experimental scenarios, achieving precise
landing of a drone on a moving target with speeds of up to 20km/h. The results obtained reveal the high applicability and potential
of this technology, to facilitate the exploration of autonomous drone solutions in cities.
